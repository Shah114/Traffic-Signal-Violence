# Traffic-Signal-Violence
This repository contains a project for detecting traffic signal violations using the YOLOv8m model. The project is implemented using Python and utilizes the following libraries: OpenCV, ultralytics, os, and numpy. The model is capable of identifying and flagging instances of vehicles running red lights in the provided video footage. <br/>

## Introduction
Traffic signal violations, such as running a red light, are a significant cause of road accidents. This project aims to detect such violations using a pre-trained YOLOv8m model. The model processes video footage to identify vehicles that do not adhere to traffic signals, providing a practical tool for improving road safety. <br/>
